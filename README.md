This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the useParams hook in React Router v6.  The problem arises when attempting to access route parameters from a component that is not a direct child of a route element defined using the <Route> component. The useParams hook relies on the routing context, which may not be available deeper within the component tree. This often results in undefined params and runtime errors.

The repository contains two files: UnexpectedParams.jsx which showcases the problem and FixedParams.jsx which provides a working solution using context.  The solution provides a detailed explanation and alternative approaches to resolve this issue.
